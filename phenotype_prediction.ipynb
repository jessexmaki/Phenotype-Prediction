        "# Phenotype Prediction Case Study\n",
        "\n",
        "The model organism *Drosophila melanogaster*, commonly known as the fruit fly, has been one of the most important and well-studied systems in biological and biomedical research. Early studies utilizing *D. melanogaster* were instrumental in elucidating foundational principles of genetics and inheritance, including characterization of mutagenesis. Furthermore, the fruit fly has been extensively utilized to investigate neural biology and neurodevelopment, enabling key insights into human neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. \n",
        "\n",
        "The close evolutionary relationship between *D. melanogaster* and humans has also enabled the former's utility for modeling early human migrations. Through these studies, researchers have gained critical understanding of local adaptation as human populations expanded out of Africa.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the fruit fly represented one of the first animal models for comprehensive investigation of genotype-phenotype linkages across the whole genome. In 2012, the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) project fully sequenced and released nearly 200 \"reference\" fly lines, along with matched phenotype data. The DGRP serves as a public resource to enable diverse genome-phenotype association studies, with all data freely available online (http://dgrp.gnets.ncsu.edu/).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this research, we develop a neural network approach to model the genotype-phenotype map between genomic variation and lifespan in fruit flies. Specifically, we aim to predict \"longevity\" phenotypes from >17,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes assayed across the autosomal chromosomes of 182 Drosophila lines."

        "## Data Curation and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "The SNP genotype and longevity phenotype data for 182 Drosophila lines were obtained from the publicly available DGRP resource. For this project, we utilized a subset of these data files provided in comma-separated values (.csv) format. \n",
        "\n",
        "The .csv file structure enables simple storage of the genome-wide SNP profiles, with each row representing a fly line. The SNPs are encoded as binary values in adjacent columns. Additional columns capture the unique line identifier (\"SID\") and experimentally measured longevity score (\"LS\") for each genotype. \n",
        "\n",
        "CSV files are widely used for storing biological data and can be easily imported into programming environments like Python and R for analysis. We leverage this capability to ingest the data and convert to formats amenable for neural network training, without directly manipulating the raw genotype values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we import the remote .csv file into a pandas DataFrame using the URL:\n",
        "\n",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryankolaczkowski/ALS3200C/main/phenopred.data.csv\n",
        "\n",
        "This encompasses all 182 lines, with SNPs in 17,165 columns and the \"LS\" phenotype values. We then sample and split this DataFrame into disjoint training and validation sets for model fitting and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "While data preprocessing steps like imputation and normalization can be beneficial for genome-wide association studies, we avoid any direct manipulation of the genotypes themselves to preclude inadvertently biasing later analysis. However, conversion from DataFrames to NumPy arrays and TensorFlow Datasets does facilitate model implementation in the following sections."

        "## Mitigating Overfitting with Input Layer Dropout\n",
        "\n",
        "A common challenge when training on limited genetic data is overfitting, where the model memorizes noise and biases in the training set. This reduces generalizability to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate overfitting, we apply dropout - randomized exclusion of inputs - on the SNP genotype data during training. This relies on the redundancy of information across the large number of variants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, an InputLayer is first added to explicitly define the input shape. A Dropout layer is then applied, set to aggressively drop 90% of SNP values on each batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approximately reduces the informative dimensionality from 17,165 down to 1,726. However, critically, all SNPs are retained during validation and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "By stochastically removing inputs, the network is prevented from relying on particular variants as predictive signals. This encourages more robust fitting based on additive effects across many SNPs.\n",
        "\n",
        "While 90% dropout is extreme, the vast discrepancy between sample size (N=146) and SNPs (P=17,165) necessitates aggressive regularization. More modest dropout rates of 0.2-0.5 are commonly used with larger datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preliminary results indicate this input dropout effectively reduces overfitting, as measured by the similarity between training and validation losses after fitting. Future work should further confirm these improvements on independent test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, input layer dropout provides a straightforward mechanism to improve genetic model generalization in the context of limited sample sizes, a common challenge in genomics applications."

        "## Conclusions and Future Directions\n",
        "The preliminary neural network modeling conducted in this study provides early evidence to support a primarily additive genetic architecture underlying natural variation in Drosophila longevity phenotypes. The ability to achieve a reasonable fit using a simple linear model suggests longevity may be influenced by the cumulative small effects of many genes without substantial statistical epistasis.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, while aggressive input regularization via SNP dropout reduced overfitting in the context of limited sample sizes, the model has not yet been rigorously evaluated on fully independent test data. The constraints on data availability precluded partitioning into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow-up studies should prioritize acquisition of additional sequenced fly lines to enable holding out a test set that can facilitate unbiased assessment of expected modeling performance on new data. This would provide greater certainty regarding the generalized predictive capacity beyond the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The extreme input dropout employed herein aided overfitting at the cost of reduced biological interpretability. As data resources expand, more modest regularization rates may help balance generalization with mechanistic elucidation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future modeling should also evaluate more complex nonlinear neural network architectures to thoroughly survey the genotype-phenotype landscape. Comparing performance across a diverse array of models using cross-validation procedures could further validate the predominance of additive genetic effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expanding the diversity of sequenced Drosophila lines beyond the currently available inbred panels will be critical for enhancing biological relevance. Incorporating natural heterozygosity and population-level linkage patterns will help translate findings from the model system towards applications in outbred populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this research demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of applying modern machine learning techniques to elucidate the genomic basis of complex traits. Continued efforts to expand open genomic data resources within the nourishing ecosystem of open science will help fully realize the promise of artificial intelligence approaches in biology."
